# autotrader17

The Manchester SIAM-IMA Student Chapter hosted an industry problem solving [event](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~siam/autotrader17) 
event in collaboration with [Autotrader](http://www.autotrader.co.uk/).
These minimal examples represent a couple of hours playing around with the two
datasets.

In particular, I had fun learning about Gaussian Mixture Models and Expectation
Maximisation for clustering using the excellent package by 
[davidavdav](https://github.com/davidavdav) 
called [GaussianMixtures.jl](https://github.com/davidavdav/GaussianMixtures.jl).
